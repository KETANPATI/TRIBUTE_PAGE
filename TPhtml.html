                <h1>The Flying Sikh in Indian</h1>  20 November 1929 ( 18 June 2021)  was an Indian track and field sprinter who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army. 
                    He is the only athlete to win gold at 400 metres at the Asian Games as well as the Commonwealth Games.
                    He also won gold medals in the 1958 and 1962 Asian Games. He represented India in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne,
                    the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour,
                    in recognition of his sporting achievements.

                    The race for which Singh was best remembered is his fourth-place finish in the 400 metres final at the 1960 Olympic Games, 
                    which he had entered as one of the favourites. He led the race till the 200m mark before easing off, allowing others to pass him. 
                    Various records were broken in the race, which required a photo-finish and saw American Otis Davis being declared the winner by one-hundredth of a second over German Carl Kaufmann. 
                    From beginnings that saw him orphaned and displaced during the Partition of India, Singh has become a sporting icon in his country.
                    In 2008, journalist Rohit Brijnath described Singh as "the finest athlete India has ever produced
                    (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                    space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile
                    Man
                    Singh died from complications of COVID-19 on 18 June 2021, at the age of 91, five days after his wife, Nirmal Saini.

                    <h4><b>International career</b></h4>
                    <p>Singh represented India in the 200m and 400m competitions of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games.[12] His inexperience meant that he did not progress from the heat stages but a meeting with the eventual 400m champion at those Games, Charles Jenkins, 
                        both inspired him to greater things and provided him with information about training methods.
                        In 1958, Singh set records for the 200m and 400m in the National Games of India, held at Cuttack,[11] and also won gold medals in the same events at the Asian Games. 
                        He then won a gold medal in the 400m (440 yards at this time) competition at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games with a time of 46.6 seconds.[10]
                        This latter achievement made him the first gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games from independent India.[9] Before Vikas Gowda won the gold in 2014,
                        Milkha was the only Indian male to have won an individual athletics gold medal at those Games.
